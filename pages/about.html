                <h3>Derek aka Charles Francis Xavier</h3>
                <p>
                    As most of you have probably guessed, my name is Derek
                    and I'm a semi-professional poker player.<br /><br />

                    I have been playing poker for several years now. While
                    I have had a few decent scores in MTTs, my main focus has
                    been 6-max hyper SNGs.<br /><br />

                    I decided to start this blog to help fellow players
                    in the community. I hope you gain something from it
                    and are able to improve your game!<br /><br />

                    Cheers
