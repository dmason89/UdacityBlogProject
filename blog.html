                <p>
                    Here are a few strategies that can greatly improve
                    your win rate: <br /><br />

                    <b>Play Tight In Early Rounds</b><br />
                    You typically start with a short stack and blinds move fast.
                    Only play a solid range in the first stage so you have chips
                    to shove later on<br /><br />

                    <b>Know Your ICM</b><br />
                    6 max hypers are all about know when to shove/fold. Study
                    ICM and know the right ranges for each position.<br /><br />

                    <b>Pick Your Battles</b><br />
                    Your goal is to profit. When you're on the bubble and
                    you don't have the biggest stack, be cautious. Let the other
                    short stack bust.<br /><br />

                <h2 id="jumpTwo">Tracking Your Opponents</h2>
                <p>
                    Why should you track your opponents? <br /><br />

                    Having as much info as possible on your opponents
                    can only help you. Say you sit down at a new table 
                    and your opponents goes all-in the very first hand. 
                    Well, with no knowledge on this individual, you may
                    call or fold in a spot you really shouldn't have.<br /><br />

                    Say we are in the same exact spot, only this time we have
                    looked up our opponent and see they have a -28% roi. You
                    probably will feel a lot more comfortable making the call with
                    your pocket 8's<br /><br />

                    The best tracking out there is <a href="https://www.sharkscope.com/" target="_blank">
                    Sharkscope</a> There are free and paid options that will
                    surely be worth it<br /><br />
